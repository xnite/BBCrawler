# Welcome
This used to be my personal private source code. Please forgive the lack of configuration options, comments in the code, and documentation as I never intended for this code to be published.
However, since I have decided to publish this source, I am placing it under the GNU AGPLv3 license to ensure that any modifications to the source are also made available to everyone.

With all of that being said, this source code is provided as-is for educational purposes, and I assume no liability for what you do with it. You can read more about BBCrawler in [my blog post](https://rob.cat/projects/minecraft/2024/12/25/bbcrawler-minecraft-server-scanner.html).

## Getting Started
I wrote a [quickstart guide](https://github.com/xnite/BBCrawler/wiki/Quick-Start) to help you get started with BBCrawler. If you need more information about the various configuration options then please refer to the [configuration page](https://github.com/xnite/BBCrawler/wiki/Configuration).
